# <div align="center"> Analyzing Bigfoot and UFO Sightings in the United States

![Alt](./images/bigfoot_ufo.png)

### Background and Objectives

In the United States, thousands of people have claimed to witness Bigfoot and UFO sightings nationwide. With these two types of sightings, our team wanted to investigate the relationships by analyzing web-scraped data from [The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html) and [Geographic Database of Bigfoot / Sasquatch Sightings & Reports Database](http://www.bfro.net/gdb/). Some of the initial relationships we wanted to evaluate were geographical location of sightings, seasonality of sightings, quantity of sightings through the years and an analysis of text for each type of sighting. Additionally, we wanted to build a machine learning algorithm to see if we could predict which type of sighting was observed based on the text of the report using Natural Language Processing (NLP). NOTE: WE SHOULD INCLUDE A DATE RANGE PROBABLY LIKE OVER LAST 50 YEARS.

### Initial Assumptions

Prior to starting our analysis, we wanted to gather our initial assumptions and compare them with the real life data. Some of our assumptions included:

* There are going to be significantly more UFO sightings than Bigfoot sightings in the U.S.
* The decade with the most UFO sightings will be in the 1980's while the decade with most Bigfoot sightings is 1970's
* The U.S. region with the most UFO sightings will be in the Southwest while Bigfoot sightings will be in Northwest
* The majority of the Bigfoot sightings occur in the colder months while the majority of UFO sightings occur in the summer

### Raw Data Review

(Insert Screenshot of Data tables for each and describe the features and the big differences between the two datasets)

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

(Insert simple histogram plot for total UFO sightings vs. Bigfoot sightings -- 2 bars)
(Insert Histogram Plot of UFO vs. Bigfoot Sightings over the years -- stacked bars if possible -- Do we need to normalize the data?)
(Insert U.S. Bubble Map Plot showing the clusters of UFO / Bigfoot sightings on same Map -- Different colors for each type)
(Insert Seasonality Plots for UFO and Bigfoot --- Side by Side plot or on same axes?)
(Insert in Wordclouds for each type of sighting)

### Data Cleaning Process

(Include synopsis of how we had to clean the data i.e. converting duration values to integers, converting datetime, converting locations, etc)

### Machine Learning Algorithms 

NLP Algorithm discussion --- Naive Bayes for predicting the classification of each type of report 
NLP Algorithm discussion --- PCA or NMF for finding the most 'important features' or words of each type of report
