# <div align="center"> Analyzing Bigfoot and UFO Sightings in the United States

![Alt](./bigfoot_ufo.png)

### Background and Objectives

In the United States, thousands of people have claimed to witness Bigfoot and UFO sightings nationwide. With these two types of sightings, our team wanted to investigate the relationships by analyzing web-scraped data from [The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html) and [Geographic Database of Bigfoot / Sasquatch Sightings & Reports Database](http://www.bfro.net/gdb/). Some of the initial relationships we wanted to evaluate were geographical location of sightings, seasonality of sightings, quantity of sightings through the years and an analysis of text for each type of sighting. Additionally, we wanted to build a machine learning algorithm to see if we could predict which type of sighting was observed based on the text of the report using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### Initial Assumptions

Prior to starting our analysis, we wanted to gather our initial assumptions and compare them with the real life data. Some of our assumptions included:

* There are going to be significantly more UFO sightings than Bigfoot sightings in the U.S.
* The U.S. region with the most UFO sightings will be in the Southwest while Bigfoot sightings will be in Northwest
* The majority of the Bigfoot sightings occur in the colder months while the majority of UFO sightings occur in the summer
